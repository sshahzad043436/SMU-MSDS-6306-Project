Project Purpose
---------------

The purpose of this project is to analyze the possible market
penetration for Budweiser Ale and IPA Beers.

Budweiser Investigation
-----------------------

Budweisrer is looking to create Ale and IPA beers to further reach their
customers. Budweiser asked to study the market and see if and where the
best locations and beer types would be best for market penetration.

Investigation Results
---------------------

The study was using beer data from across the 48 Contiguous states and
the various breweries that create Ale and IPA beers. By using this data
we are able to determine the possible taste, best market penetration,
and which beers would be a best fit per region and state. Fidings show
that the North Central would have the best potential for Budweiser Ale
penetraion where as the west coast be best for both ALE and IPAs. THe
Northeast and South have the least marketshare for Ale and IPAs and
would not be a good suggestion for high volume sales.
